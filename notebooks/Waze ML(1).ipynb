To achieve this, I built and evaluated three tree-based models: a **Decision Tree**, a **Random Forest**, and an **XGBoost**. These models will help identify the key factors that contribute to user churn and allow me to anticipate user behavior more effectively."

    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Retained Users**: Approximately **82%**\n",
    "* **Churned Users**: Approximately **18%**\n",
    "\n",
    "With 18% of users having churned, our dataset exhibits a **moderate class imbalance**. While this imbalance is not severe enough to require advanced rebalancing techniques (like SMOTE), it's a critical consideration for metric selection. Relying solely on **accuracy** would be misleading; a naive model that always predicts the majority class could achieve a high accuracy of 82% without ever identifying a single user at risk of churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Selecting the Optimal Evaluation Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of metric must align with the business objective and the consequences of model errors. In this project, it was determined that the risk associated with a **false positive** prediction (the model predicts a user will churn, but they won't) is minimal. A loyal user might receive an unnecessary retention offer, but this carries no significant negative consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a **false negative** prediction (the model predicts a user will not churn, but they do) has a direct and tangible business impact: Waze misses a crucial opportunity to retain a customer. To maximize the detection of all users who are likely to churn, it is imperative to prioritize **recall**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the primary metric for evaluating and selecting the best model will be **recall**. A high recall score will ensure that we identify the largest possible proportion of at-risk users, enabling Waze to implement targeted and effective retention strategies."

It also has the highest accuracy (0.73) and recall (0.76), meaning it’s the most effective at correctly identifying positive cases while still being fairly accurate overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Random Forest** model comes in second. Its F1 score (0.48) and accuracy (0.73) are just slightly lower than XGBoost’s, and it has better precision than the Decision Tree, which means it makes fewer false positive predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* All three models have strong recall, so they’re good at finding the positives.\n",
    "* Precision is a weakness across the board, none of them go above 0.38. This means they tend to overpredict positives, which could lead to many false alarms.\n",
    "* Since these are training-stage cross-validation results, the next step would be to tune the models (e.g., adjust class weights or thresholds) to improve precision without losing too much recall.\n"

    "Based on the validation results with optimized thresholds, the Decision Tree identifies a high proportion of users likely to churn, reflected in its high recall of 0.73. However, its low precision of 0.30 indicates many false positives, making it less reliable overall. Random Forest provides a better balance between precision and recall, achieving a higher F1-score of 0.44 and strong accuracy of 0.74, suggesting it can more reliably predict at-risk users while minimizing false alerts. XGBoost achieves the highest F1-score at 0.45 and maintains a high recall of 0.69, making it the most effective model at detecting potential churn while keeping false positives reasonable. These results indicate that optimizing the prediction threshold significantly improves the trade-off between precision and recall. Overall, XGBoost appears to be the most suitable model for anticipating user churn and informing retention strategies, with Random Forest as a close alternative. The Decision Tree, while simpler and more interpretable, is less effective due to its lower precision."

    "The XGBoost model with the optimized threshold is the most effective for predicting Waze user churn. It successfully identifies a large portion of users likely to churn (high recall) while maintaining a reasonable balance with precision. Although precision is moderate, the model provides a reliable tool for detecting at-risk users, enabling targeted retention strategies. Threshold optimization on the validation set maximized the model’s effectiveness before final evaluation on the test set, confirming its robustness and ability to generalize to unseen data."

    "The confusion matrix for XGBoost on the test set highlights the model’s performance in classifying Waze users. Out of all non-churning users, 6,507 were correctly identified (true negatives), while 2,904 were incorrectly predicted as churners (false positives). Among the actual churners, 1,308 were correctly detected (true positives), and 721 were missed (false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms the earlier observations from the metrics: the model achieves a relatively high recall (0.64), meaning it successfully identifies a large portion of users likely to churn. However, the precision remains moderate (0.31), indicating a substantial number of false positives. Overall, XGBoost provides a reliable tool for detecting at-risk users, striking a practical balance between capturing churn cases and controlling false alerts, which is essential for designing targeted retention strategies."

    "### **Analysis of Feature Importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data shows the relative importance of different features in the XGBoost model, which are known for their ability to rank features. The higher the score, the more impact a feature has on the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Top Predictors:** The most important features are **activity\\_days (88.0)**, **total\\_navigations\\_fav1 (67.0)**, and **n\\_days\\_after\\_onboarding (57.0)**. These are the primary drivers for the model's output. This suggests that the duration of a user's activity, their engagement with a specific type of navigation, and how long they have been a user are the most critical factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Mid-tier Predictors:** Features like **percent\\_sessions\\_in\\_lats\\_moonth (56.0)**, **duration\\_minutes\\_drives (49.0)**, **km\\_per\\_driving\\_day (40.0)**, and **driving\\_days (40.0)** also play a significant role. These features are related to the intensity and recency of a user's driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Low-impact Predictors:** Features such as **km\\_per\\_drive (7.0)**, **sessions (6.0)**, and **professional\\_driver (2.0)** have very little influence on the model's predictions. This is an important finding, as it suggests these variables do not provide much predictive power, and you might consider removing them to simplify the model without a significant loss in performance. The fact that `professional_driver` has such a low score is particularly interesting, as one might expect it to be a key factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model heavily relies on **user activity and engagement metrics**, particularly those related to the duration and type of navigation. The number of days a user has been active and the recency of their sessions are far more predictive than the total number of sessions or the average length of a drive. The low importance of `professional_driver` suggests that driving patterns might not differ significantly between professional and non-professional users in a way that is useful for this model."

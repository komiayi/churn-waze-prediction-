# Waze Churn Prediction

A clean and well-structured Jupyter Notebook project that predicts users at high risk of churn using machine learning. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with Random Forest and XGBoost. A dynamic threshold optimization approach is applied to balance precision and recall, maximizing the F1-score. Model interpretability is addressed through feature importance analysis of the best-performing XGBoost model.
